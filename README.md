# Description
This tool allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt files by entering a password, selecting an input file, and choosing an output file location. It uses the AES-256 encryption algorithm, which is one of the strongest encryption standards available, making it suitable for sensitive data protection. 

# The process involves the following steps:
The user supplies a password, which is used to derive a cryptographic key via the Scrypt key derivation function.
The file selected as input is encrypted with AES-GCM and saved at the specified output location.
A similar process applies for decryption, requiring the password to restore the original contents.

# Where It Will Be UsedData Security: 
This tool is ideal for securely storing or transmitting sensitive files, such as legal documents, financial records, or personal information.
File Sharing: It can be used to protect files sent via email, cloud storage, or removable devices by encrypting them before transfer.
Backup Protection: Encrypt backups to prevent unauthorized access in case storage media are lost or stolen.
General Usage: Useful for anyone who needs simple, reliable encryption with minimal setup, no command-line required.Tools and Technologies UsedPython: Main programming language for logic and GUI.Tkinter: Used for creating the tool’s graphical user interface (window, labels, entries, buttons).
cryptography Library: Provides implementation for cryptographic functions, especially Scrypt (KDF) and AESGCM (AES with GCM mode).

# CONCLUSION
OS Library: Used for file operations and generating random nonce values for encryption.
The tool offers a user-friendly way to apply modern cryptography principles and is suitable for both personal and professional file protection needs.
